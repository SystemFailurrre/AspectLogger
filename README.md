# AspectLogger
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) Logger in C#

### Project Description:

The "Aspect-Oriented Logging" project is created with the aim of exploring the aspect-oriented programming paradigm through the example of a logging system. Within this project, two primary approaches have been utilized: the first involving the use of the Fody library, and the second employing decorators.

### Key Project Features:

* Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): AOP enables the separation of cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, from the main codebase, contributing to a cleaner and more modular architecture.

* Integration of Fody: In one of the approaches, the Fody library, a popular tool for aspect weaving in C# projects, is employed. This approach provides an automated way to inject aspects, including logging, during the compilation process.

* Application of Decorators: In the second approach, the project leverages decorators, which allow for the dynamic addition of functionality, such as logging, to existing code. This method offers greater flexibility in configuring logging and applying it to different parts of the application.

### Project Goals:

* Gain experience in using the Fody library and understanding its capabilities for automating aspects in C# projects.
* Master the principles of applying decorators for logging and other aspects of the program.
